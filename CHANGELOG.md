# Changelog

All notable changes to the PocketOBI firmware are documented here.
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

The version is defined in `PocketOBI.ino` as `FW_VERSION` and shown
on the on-device "Version / info" screen.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- **False "suspect hardware" verdict on healthy BL1850B packs.** The on-device Debug
  screen showed "Latched: YES" and the verdict read SUSPECT on packs that are balanced,
  unlocked and working, because the low-level BMS marker it relied on turned out
  to be a constant these packs always carry, not a stored fault. The marker no longer
  affects the verdict; a genuinely locked pack is still detected by its charger lock. The
  Debug screen now shows the raw marker bytes for reference. (Reported via issue #13.)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-28

First public release since 1.0.0 — the **V2 interface** on a **single-source build**.
(The `2.0.0` line was developed but never published; its work ships here as part of `2.1.0`.)

### Added
- **New V2 interface.** A 2×2 launcher (Battery / Repair / Tools / About), encoder-driven,
  that jumps straight to the Battery view when a pack is connected.
- **Paged Battery view** (turn the encoder): Overview / Health / Identity.
  - *Overview* — per-cell voltage bars (green / yellow / red), pack voltage, cell spread.
  - *Health* — our own cycle-based Condition estimate, over-discharge / over-load wear
    counters, cell min/max + spread, and both temperature sensors + spread.
  - *Identity* — model, charge count, manufacturing date, capacity, and the pack
    **serial number** (ROM ID in Makita 16-char hex format).
- **Traffic-light verdict** — HEALTHY / REPAIRABLE / REAL FAULT, plus an orange
  "possible HW fix" tier — shown on the Battery tile and screens.
- **Repair wizard** — a staged, feasibility-first decision tree: comms check →
  hardware faults (broken sense wire / weak group / imbalance / thermistor, each naming
  the group or sensor) → lock + prognosis (false lockout "should hold" vs a memorised
  fault "unlikely to hold"). A hardware fault blocks the unlock.
- **Multilingual UI** — English, French, German, Spanish.
- **Desk compatibility contract** (PC-bridge opcode `0x02`) reporting a protocol version,
  battery-family id and cell count, so PocketOBI Desk routes to the right decoder and shows
  a non-blocking warning on a version mismatch. The bridge transport stays a stable drop-in
  ArduinoOBI regardless of version.

### Changed
- **Single-source build — the PlatformIO mirror is gone.** A root `platformio.ini`
  (`src_dir = .`) now builds the same files the Arduino IDE compiles, straight from the
  sketch folder; the old `platformio/` mirror project and its `sync.ps1` / `sync.sh` are
  removed. `PocketOBI.ino` stays at the repo root, so the Arduino IDE build is unchanged —
  one set of sources, both toolchains, nothing to keep in sync.
- **Thermistor finding is now evidence-based**, an observation plus a suggested re-check
  rather than a bare "replace the sensor"; a sensor-spread divergence is a soft "possible
  HW fix" that does **not** block the unlock.
- **One verdict everywhere.** The Repair wizard banner shows the exact same verdict —
  word, colour and icon — as the Battery tile, computed from a single source.
- **The undecoded raw "status" byte no longer drives any decision.** The error-reset
  result now tracks the real BMS fault register (LOCKED → OK = "cleared", still LOCKED =
  "unchanged", nothing set = "no error to clear"); the raw byte is shown only on the Debug
  screen, marked undecoded.
- **Repair prognosis reads as guidance, not a guarantee** — a memorised-fault marker is a
  hint ("unlikely to hold"), never a hard verdict, and never blocks an unlock attempt.

### Fixed
- **PC bridge hardening** — serial buffers are bounded against oversized `len` / `rsp_len`,
  and truncated frames are dropped instead of half-executed (the PC app simply resends).
- **Removed the dead V1 menu/screen cluster** (~225 lines) left unreachable under V2
  navigation.
- **PC-bridge interface version derives from the firmware version** (was hardcoded/stale).

### Notes
- The public version jumps **`v1.0.0 → v2.1.0`**; `2.0.0` was internal-only.
- Licence: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (unchanged from 1.0.0). Upstream Open Battery
  Information and the bundled OneWire2 remain MIT — see `THIRD-PARTY.md`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

First official, stable release. The core decodes (protocol, temperature, cell
voltages, capacity, charge count) are cross-validated on real packs. A larger V2
(more readouts + UI overhaul) is planned separately.

### Changed
- **Faulty-thermistor reading now flagged explicitly.** When a temperature sensor
  reads outside the plausible window it is shown with a leading `!` in red on the
  home chip (e.g. `!-30/31`) = suspected **faulty sensor / hardware fault**, not a
  real extreme temperature. (A dead thermistor pins near -30 C.)

### Validated
- **Temperature unit (1/10 K) validated on real packs.** Readings from several packs
  (including one with a known faulty thermistor) confirm `T_C = raw/10 - 273.15`, and
  that a dead thermistor reads a pinned absurd value (~ -30 C) — exactly the behaviour
  PocketOBI already flags. No decode change needed; the comments now record it.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Details screen: state-of-health estimate + protection thresholds.** The
  standard-battery Details view now shows `Health~` (a cycle-based SoH *estimate*,
  the `~` marking it as an estimate rather than the BMS's own gauge) and
  `Prot OL/OD` (over-current / over-discharge protection thresholds, in %). All
  three are decoded from the ROM message frame already read — **no extra bus
  traffic**. The decodes are corroborated by both sides of the
  [m5din-makita](https://github.com/no-body-in-particular/m5din-makita) fork (its
  reader and its BMS emulator store/read the same bytes the same way). Values are
  best-effort: the absolute figures are not yet confirmed against a bench meter.
- **Dual capacity-format decode.** Battery capacity (frame byte 16) is now decoded
  for both encodings: newer packs store it directly in whole Ah, older packs store
  a nibble-swapped value in tenths of an Ah. (From the MIT-licensed
  [drakosha/makita-battery-tools](https://github.com/drakosha/makita-battery-tools).)

### Documented
- **Secondary frame checksums (CS3/CS4 in byte 31).** Added an in-code note on the
  two secondary checksums (byte 31: covers bytes 22-23 and 24-30, the latter
  including overload / over-discharge / cycle-count). No behaviour change - the
  unlock only touches the CS2 range - but any future write to bytes 22-30 must
  recompute byte 31. Corroborated by drakosha/makita-battery-tools, whose decode of
  the three primary checksums matches ours exactly.

### Changed
- Temperature-unit note (README + code comment) upgraded from "disputed" to
  "well-supported": the 1/10 K decode is now corroborated by four independent
  sources (rosvall, obi-esp32, and both the reader and BMS emulator of the
  m5din-makita fork). Open Battery Information's Celsius×100 is the outlier.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **PlatformIO build** (`platformio/`): a conventional PlatformIO project
  (src/ + lib/) for VS Code users, alongside the Arduino IDE build. It mirrors
  the root Arduino sources via `platformio/sync.ps1` / `sync.sh`; the root
  `PocketOBI.ino` remains the single source of truth. (Addresses issue #1.)

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- The home temperature chip now shows **both sensors** (cell / MOSFET, e.g.
  `28/31`) instead of only the cell reading, so a disagreement between the two is
  visible at a glance. It turns red when either reading is outside the plausible
  window (likely faulty thermistor). F0513 (single sensor) is unchanged.
- README/HARDWARE wording tidied for the public release; the unlock/repair is
  described by its scope (clears a false charger lockout on an otherwise-healthy
  pack; never overrides the BMS's own fault protection).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed / hardened (pre-release audit against all protocol sources)
- **PC bridge** now reports the real firmware version in the interface-version
  query (was hardcoded to 0.8.x).
- **F0513**: clear `romId`/`msg` on the F0513 path so Debug/raw no longer shows
  stale data left over from a previously-read standard pack.
- **10-cell / 36V packs (BL36xx)**: detected (battery type >= 30) and shown as
  "not supported (18V only)" instead of a misleading 5-cell dashboard.
- **Robustness**: guard against a `uint8_t` underflow if a `0x33` command were
  ever defined with `rsp_len < 8`.
- Added a note that the **F0513 temperature unit is unverified** (kept at /100;
  the standard path uses 1/10 K).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- Implausible-temperature flag: when the cell temperature falls outside a
  plausible window (`TEMP_MIN_PLAUS`..`TEMP_MAX_PLAUS`, -20..80 C), the home
  temperature chip turns red and shows a trailing `?` (e.g. `T -30?`) — a
  likely faulty thermistor. It is a suspicion, not a confirmed diagnosis.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **Temperature decoding**: the protocol reports temperature in **1/10 K**
  (`raw = (T_C + 273.15) * 10`), not Celsius x100. Cell and MOSFET temperatures
  are now decoded as `raw / 10 - 273.15`. Previous values were a few degrees off
  on a healthy pack, and — more importantly — a **faulty thermistor** (which
  reports an absurd value the charger rejects as a "temperature" fault) now shows
  its true reading (e.g. ~ -30 C) instead of a misleading normal-looking number.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- Serial trace of the raw frame write/store (`ow33`) under `COMM_DEBUG`, so the
  otherwise-invisible unlock writes show up in the logs.

### Fixed
- Home + Details **LOCKED/UNLOCKED** now reflects the real **charger lock**
  (nybble 34 / CS0 / CS2 mismatch, i.e. what actually makes the charger refuse a
  pack), not only the failure code (nybble 40). Details also shows a `ChgLock:`
  line listing the causes (`N34`/`CS0`/`CS1`/`CS2`). Previously a frame whose
  charger-lock nybble was set could still read UNLOCKED on screen.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Unlock / repair** menu entry: rewrites a battery frame to make the charger
  accept a pack whose cells are healthy but whose stored frame trips the charger
  lock. Clears the charger-lock nybble (nybble 34) and recomputes all three
  frame checksums (CS0, CS1, CS2 - CS0/CS2 gate the charger, CS1 the battery's
  internal lock), then writes the frame back
  (arm `CC F0 00` -> write `33 0F 00` + 32 bytes -> store `33 55 A5`), power-
  cycles the bus and clears the internal error register. Guarded by a
  confirmation screen; if the frame is already valid, no write is performed.
  Shows the lock causes before -> after. Manufacturing/status bytes (incl.
  byte 19 / `0xA5`) and the failure code (nybble 40) are never modified.
- Result screen reporting the remaining lock causes (`CS0`/`CS1`/`CS2`/`N34`) and
  an Unlocked / Still-locked verdict.

### Changed
- **Error reset** now runs the full sequence: enter test mode -> `DA 04` ->
  exit test mode (`CC D9 FF FF`) -> bus power-cycle, so the BMS actually commits
  the internal error-register clear (previously it stopped after `DA 04`).

### Notes / credit
- The unlock/frame-repair capability is a **clean-room** reimplementation from
  publicly documented protocol facts (frame byte/nybble map, checksum ranges +
  formula, nybble-34 charger lock, arm/write/store opcodes). Sources:
  - **rosvall/makita-lxt-protocol** (Codeberg) — root reverse-engineering of the
    frame layout and the three checksum ranges (0-15, 16-31, 32-40).
  - **synrais/Makita-LXT-Battery-Monitor-Unlocker** — frame-repair method and the
    empirical charger-validation results (only nybble 34, CS0, CS2 gate the
    charger). This repo ships with **no license** (all rights reserved), so none
    of its source code is used — only the unprotectable protocol facts, cross-
    checked against real battery dumps.
  - Base protocol credit remains Open Battery Information (Martin Jansson, MIT).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Clearer lock status: home footer shows **UNLOCKED** (green) / **LOCKED** (red)
  instead of "OK". Added an explicit colored "State: UNLOCKED/LOCKED" line to the
  Details screen.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **PC bridge mode** (menu entry "PC bridge"): the device acts as a USB <->
  OneWire bridge, a drop-in replacement for the ArduinoOBI, so the desktop
  **Open Battery Information** app talks to PocketOBI directly (select the
  Arduino OBI interface + PocketOBI's COM port). Handles the version query and
  the 0xCC / 0x33 / F0513 (0x31,0x32) commands via the existing sendCommand().
  Back button exits. Dual use: standalone tester AND PC adapter.

### Changed
- COMM_DEBUG serial tracing defaults to OFF (comms validated). It MUST stay off
  in PC bridge mode or it would corrupt the binary protocol.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Estimated state of charge (SoC ~%) on the home screen, derived from the
  average cell voltage (piecewise-linear Li-ion OCV curve; approximate, shown
  with a "~").

### Changed
- Boot now goes: splash (~1.5 s) -> menu directly. No auto-read and no
  "no battery" home screen; the user picks what to do from the menu.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Removed the auto-read at boot. The boot splash now shows for ~1.5 s as a
  simple logo screen, then the home screen appears; the user starts a read from
  the menu. (First real-hardware validation: reads a BL1860B correctly.)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Ground is now taken from the main B- terminal (simpler and more reliable than
  signal pin 5; same ground). Wiring docs updated accordingly.
- "beta" tag shown on the splash and About screens; README gains a "Step 1
  (beta)" status section and a link to The Repair Forge YouTube channel.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Tool named **PocketOBI** (standalone OBI client). Boot splash now shows the
  name in big two-tone letters ("Pocket" teal + "OBI" orange) instead of the
  logo. About screen features PocketOBI, credits "The Repair Forge" as creator,
  and keeps the base-project credit (Open Battery Information, Martin Jansson).

### Removed
- Primitive-drawn logo mark (anvil/wrench/spark) dropped in favor of the name.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Credit to the base project on the About screen: Open Battery Information by
  Martin Jansson (MIT), github.com/mnh-jansson.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Boot splash screen (title + version + "Reading battery...").
- Auto-read on startup: the tool attempts a battery read at boot, so the home
  screen shows real data immediately when a pack is present instead of always
  claiming "no battery" before ever checking.

### Changed
- Home "no battery" screen now only appears after an actual read attempt, with
  a clearer prompt ("Connect a pack, then Menu > Read battery").

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Battery communication never started: the code aborted every transaction on
  `makita.reset()` returning 0. The Makita BMS does not assert a standard
  OneWire presence pulse, so the official ArduinoOBI ignores that return value.
  We now reset and talk regardless, and detect "no battery" from an all-0xFF
  response instead.

### Added
- COMM_DEBUG serial trace of every OneWire transaction (presence flag, ROM ID,
  received bytes) to diagnose battery communication on real hardware.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Encoder rotation direction was reversed; swapped A/B in the RotaryEncoder
  constructor so turning right moves down the menu.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Secondary "back" button support on the module's KO button (wire KO to GPIO2):
  short press = go one screen back (sub-screen -> menu, menu -> home),
  long press (>= 600 ms) = jump straight to home. Uses the internal pull-up,
  so it stays inert until KO is actually wired.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Menu bullets replaced with real icons drawn from primitives (battery, list,
  refresh, sun, sun-off, code, info). On the highlighted row the icon is forced
  to the light header color so it stays visible on the accent background.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-20

First versioned release. The firmware is feature-complete on the UI side but
the battery OneWire2 communication has not yet been validated against real
hardware (waiting for the battery connector).

### Added
- Standalone Makita LXT reader on ESP32-C3 + ST7789 2.4" TFT + EC11 encoder.
- OneWire2 protocol layer (bundled), commands ported from `makita_lxt.py`.
- Automatic standard / F0513 battery detection.
- Home screen with per-cell voltage bars, color-coded anomalies
  (green / yellow / red) and status chips (temperature, spread, lock/error).
- Menu: read info, details, reset error, pack LEDs on/off, debug/raw,
  version/info.
- Error reset with before -> after visual feedback.
- Dark dashboard theme: accent header bars, rounded bars, colored menu bullets.
- "Version / info" screen showing firmware version and build date.

### Hardware / libraries
- Display driven with Adafruit GFX + Adafruit ST7789 over hardware SPI.
- Encoder decoded with the RotaryEncoder library (software, ESP32-C3 compatible).

### Known / untested
- OneWire2 battery communication never tested on real hardware.
- Display orientation is landscape (`setRotation(1)`); portrait not done yet.
